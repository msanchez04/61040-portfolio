# Assignment 1

## Domains

1. Music and Conert Experiences-- I really enjoy listening to music and attending concerts. I like being able to listen to various artists using streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube, but as an avid concert-goer, it would be nice to have a platform where I can keep track of my concert experiences. Pictures and videos get lost in my camera roll, so being able to have a dedicated space for concerts specifically would be beneficial.

2. Photography and Photo Creativity-- Recently I have been exploring photography a lot more seriously. I am still familiarizing myself with photography and having a platform to explore advice or tips from other photographers, as well as being able to keep track of my progress (portfolio-like) would be refreshing. Likewise, even having the possibility to explore different kinds of cameras and tools for a period of time before fully investing could be of great help. Finally, to remain more consistent with this hobby it would be nice to have a daily challenge feature similar to BeReal, but having to fill a certain prompt/challenge of the day just for some variety and spontaneity.

3. Movie Night Planner-- Spending time with my friends during our movie nights is always exciting, but planning for them gets a bit tedious when trying to align schedules and genre interests. Being able to create shared lists of potential movies with the possibility of random selection or having a feature where movie night snacks as well as attendance can be planned would ease the struggle of planning movie nights.

4. Interior Design-- I like to rearrange my room periodically and being able to visualize the floor plan before moving would be resourceful. This is something I have to do every move-in and having a platform where knowing the measurements of different pieces of furniture I own before moving in would reduce the time I spend deciding where I would like my furniture.

5. Running-- I recently started running and would enjoy it more if there was a more beginner friendly platform that could help me journal experiences, keep track of shoes, and work towards personal goals similar to Strava/Nike Run Club without having to add another subscription.

6. Student Productivity/Organization-- It is hard to keep track of all the different organizational platforms that exist all of which have their own perks but are sometimes too cluttered/difficult to use (the way Notion is for me).

7. Plant Care-- Keeping up with my plant during the semester sometimes gets too busy, so reminders and tips for care would help.

8. Baking-- I like baking and trying new recipes, but sometimes I don't have all the ingredients ahead of time and want to just try making something with what I have.

9. Holidays and Gifting-- Birthdays and holidays get chaotic when I have to think about what to get my family and friends. It would be easier to spread out ideas I could have for each person or maybe have an integration of their wish lists to simplify gift-giving.

10. Self Care Organization-- Oftentimes I am reccomended different products for various aspects of self care on different platforms like TikTok/Instagram. When I go to stores where I could find and purchase these products like Sephora/Ulta, I tend to forget the products that were reccomended/I wanted to try and find it impossible to find in the moment. Keeping track of different products I am interested in for different categories like makeup or hair and also what works and doesn't for me can help me explore new options as well as find what personally works best.

## Problems

### Music and Conert Experiences

1. Filtering Concert Memories: After many concert experiences, it is hard to go through all the recorded footage and filter through different experiences unless searching by date specifically or hand crafting dedicated albums.

2. Exploring Nearby Concerts: If not well promoted, different concerts that may be of interest can be missed. Using sites like Ticketmaster require filtering through various venues, locations, and artists.

3. Tracking Setlists: Keeping up with an artists setlist can be a good way to practice and get a look at the songs that will be played in the concert as well as helping remember the concert experience afterwards.

### Photography and Photo Creativity

1. Skill Development Tracking (Equipment and Settings Learning): It can be difficult to have an organized way of keeping track of personal development (a portfolio) as well as future projects while also keeping up with different cameras and learned settings.

2. Photographic Creativity: As a beginner it can be overwhelming trying to find engaging ways to improve skills or gain inspiration when unsure of a next project.

3. Photo Feedback: It can be beneficial to recieve advice by other avid photographers/mentors that might help improve photo-taking and editing skills as well.

### Movie Nights

1. Movie Night Planner: Hard to come up with movie ideas on the spot and deciding on a movie/genre between a large group of people can result in a waste of time due to conflicts.

2. Snack/Host Coordination: Not ony is it hard to decide on a movie but additional factors like deciding a mutual place to host the movie night as well as what everyone could contribute becomes burdensome.

3. Scheduling Conflicts: Having to use multiple platforms (like Google Calendar and When2Meet) to find a time that works for everyone.

## Selected Problems

1. Filtering Concert Memories: I chose to include this problem because having a platform that can help organize concert footage by artists and experiences can make this idea more personalizable. I could see users benefitting from having a platform where they can document the concerts they have attended while having a concise way of reliving the experience. Being able to keep track of concert footage by artist and including more personalizable features like built-in countdown could help make every concert experience more unique and memorable.

2. Skill Development Tracking (Equipment and Settings Learning): I chose to include this problem because as a beginner it is difficult to find ways in which new skills and setting can be learned while also keeping track of personal progress. Having a journal-like platform where handy learnings can be tracked as well as having a visual diary of photographic development through time can be motivational to apsiring photographers.

3. Movie Night Planner: I chose to include this problem because oftentimes picking a movie among friends is difficult either because noone can agree on a choice or because their is a lack of inspiration. A platform that can combine shared lists, ratings, or randomizers can streamline a movie selection among friends making it easier to decide on a movie including personalizable features to many the platform more user-friendly.

## Excluded Problems

1. Exploring Nearby Concerts: There are apps like Ticketmaster that already have the basic functionality, but may not be as straightforward. I chose to not select this problem because I don't think a solution would be much different than what already exists.

2. Tracking Setlists: Setlist playlist are already created by fans on different streaming platforms. It would be a matter of consolidating them onto a platform rather than searching for a playlist on Spotify which in the end seems redundant.

3. Photographic Creativity: It can be easy to find inspiration online with social media and might limit originality among users.

4. Photo Feedback: A platform targeted just for feedback might be difficult to maintain engagement with if it is the sole purpose.

5. Snack/Host Coordination: This is overall a minor issue and might not reach enough of an audience for usage. Would work more as an additional feature possibly.

6. Scheduling Conflicts: Once again, this issue is not enough to require a whole platform and can be solved with existing apps. Having it as a feature seems more reasonable.

## Stakeholders

1. Filtering Concert Memories: Concertgoer(user documenting concert experiences); Friends(people who attended the concert with user or are viewing the users footage); Artist(performer). Impacts: Concertgoer negatively impacted by disorganized/lost concert memories not being able to relive the concert as desired. Friends able to consolidate footage from seperate devices or gain inspiration for future concerts. Artists could benefit from increased fan engagement through shared content.

2. Skill Development Tracking (Equipment and Settings Learning): Aspiring Photographer(user tracking skills and progress); Peers(other users providing advice/feedback); Photography Community(photography enthusiasts). Impacts: Aspiring Photographer wanting to visualize their photographic growth. Peers can gain inspiration from posts and provide advice for improvement. Photography Community can gain engagement and share knowledge with new photographers on the platform.

3. Movie Night Planner: Organize(user that is hosting the movie night); Friends(users attending the movie night); Streaming Platform(platforms where movie will be viewed). Impacts: Organizer benefits from movie night scheduling simplicity. Friends contribute to the decision making of the movie and scheduled date. Streaming platforms recieve more engagement from users planning events.

- [We found that, on average, Americans haven’t looked at 55% of their camera roll in the last year, and they only rarely look back on photos or videos taken a year ago or later](https://www.mixbook.com/inspiration/states-that-phlush-away-memories?srsltid=AfmBOoqY9TM672Gbg8srCwa0IGbzZtwk0wmL3wV25HWZ8VOsI6SHMIS3): A good portion of Americans don't look back on images they may have taken, but this also might be due to the fact that it is not organized, giving the platform a purpose. In a more organized manner, it might be easier and more meaningful for a person to look back and reflect on their concert experience.

- [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/): Good for storage of photos and memories, but scrap-book memory suggestion algorithm is generic and mostly random. There is no way to explictly filter concert content out by artist even through search unless by manually hand-picking.

- [EXIF Metadata Explanation](https://www.iphotography.com/blog/what-is-exif-metadata-for-photographers/): Settings are often complicated for beginners to remember/keep track of. Key information can be extracted from EXIF Metadata, which would be a good addition for the journaling component of a user's portfolio.

- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/): Has most of the basic functionality that the platform would use, but could be more personalizable. Essentially a platform to display work, but could be geared more towards beginners with targeted sections that can have helpful tips.

- [Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/): Provides an editing platform that also include important metadata about images, but doesn't have the journaling ability that might be resourceful to users in terms of tracking their learnings and findings.

The journaling option woul dbe beneficial to users as it gives them a way to reflect not only on the things they should/should not do in future shoots, but it gives other users advice for their own respective projects.

- [Photography for Beginners](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/basics.html): Photography guides like these exist for beginners, but it is often time consuming to read long guides in order to start a project. Many times recieving advice from another user/professional can be more beneficial than reading through many guides.

- [How Journal Writing Improves Your Photography](https://digital-photography-school.com/how-journal-writing-improves-your-photography/): Journaling can provide users with a clearer idea of what they want their future projects to be.

A shared planner for movie night that resolves the issue of not knowing what to watch can help create a more personalizable planning platform.

- [Netflix Engagement](https://medium.com/@vijetakarani6/how-choice-paralysis-is-costing-netflix-2-8b-annually-and-the-simple-ux-changes-that-could-fix-it-262c3f28bf15): Explores UX decisions that could improve the engagement of users with the streaming platform, Netflix. Critical to acknowledge the effect the suggested platform would have with existing streaming platforms as it would encourage overall engagement.

- [Teleparty](https://www.teleparty.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22770824594&gbraid=0AAAAAqAG0z3DxUxmBYQsb_JpFrFz1V6-p&gclid=CjwKCAjw2vTFBhAuEiwAFaScwuwPy_hY6ef9LHe7-YLznLh0Q5R0SYWKDuj2wNxgG8fyO6FjUx_TSRoChxcQAvD_BwE): A good way to watch a movie virtually with others, but difficult if someone doesn't have a specific streaming platform. More adequate for virtual movie nights rather than in-person which is the platform's target.

- [Discord](https://discord.com/): Similar to Teleparty, Discord is a good way to connect with friends and potentially watch content together, but not necesarrily relevant when it comes to in-person watch parties.

- [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/): Good in terms of organizing availability of parties and would be a key integration of the suggested platform. If there was a similar component where all users attending a watch party could fill their availability, then it would simplify the scheduling issue that comes from planning movie nights.

- [How to Pick A Movie](https://johnperritt.substack.com/p/the-challenge-of-picking-a-movie): Provides suggestions for ways in which a movie can be selected among users. Ideally if random, then all users invited to the watch party would have their own lists of "to watch" and it could be chosen from a combined overlap. Otherwise, it could be a different approach based off user watch history, but those reccomendations might be more relevant per person rather than the collective group.

- [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/): Reviews and ratings can be helpful when it comes to exploring different content options, but may not necessarily help narrow down decisions between groups.

- [Decision Fatigue](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/decision-fatigue-when-too-many-choices-leave-us-frozen-and-frustrated-5f2ff0c0a9c1): Explores the effect of presenting too many options to users which results in a negative experience instead. In our platform's case, we would want to keep suggestions and reccomendations as simple as possible to make the process of selecting a common interest easy.

- [Night Planner Ex](https://dev.to/buildandcodewithraman/movie-night-planner-your-ultimate-movie-selection-companion-4hcc): There aren't too many movie night planners in production yet, but the ones that exist have limited capabilities. Though they have reccomendations, they aren't necesarily designed to be personalizable to every party member. Likewise they miss key components that make the ultimate movie night planner like consensus scheduling.

## Features

### 1. Filtering Concert Memories
